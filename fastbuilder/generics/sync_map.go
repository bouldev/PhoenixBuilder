// Map is like a Go map[interface{}]interface{} but is safe for concurrent use
// by multiple goroutines without additional locking or coordination.
// Loads, stores, and deletes run in amortized constant time.
//
// The Map type is specialized. Most code should use a plain Go map instead,
// with separate locking or coordination, for better type safety and to make it
// easier to maintain other invariants along with the map content.
//
// The Map type is optimized for two common use cases: (1) when the entry for a given
// key is only ever written once but read many times, as in caches that only grow,
// or (2) when multiple goroutines read, write, and overwrite entries for disjoint
// sets of keys. In these two cases, use of a Map may significantly reduce lock
// contention compared to a Go map paired with a separate Mutex or RWMutex.
//
// The zero Map is empty and ready for use. A Map must not be copied after first use.
//
// In the terminology of the Go memory model, Map arranges that a write operation
// “synchronizes before” any read operation that observes the effect of the write, where
// read and write operations are defined as follows.
// Load, LoadAndDelete, LoadOrStore, Swap, CompareAndSwap, and CompareAndDelete
// are read operations; Delete, LoadAndDelete, Store, and Swap are write operations;
// LoadOrStore is a write operation when it returns loaded set to false;
// CompareAndSwap is a write operation when it returns swapped set to true;
// and CompareAndDelete is a write operation when it returns deleted set to true.
//
// Specially, generics are supported here for "sync.Map".
